# Repository `DOSI_NIHProposalProcessing`

This GitHub repository is made for storing the code and associated
documents for processing the National Institute of Health proposals that
are submitted at Duke University on a quarterly basis (e.g., Jan - Mar,
Apr - Jun, Jul - Sep, Oct - Dec). This code is made specifically for
processing the raw .csv files from the various internal websites at Duke
(e..g, SPS, RCR Tracker, LDap, etc.) and preparing the an import file
for the REDCap *Proposal Award Tracker*.

For those not affiliated with Duke University, this repository as a
whole will not be useful. However, the code may be helpful, and we
welcome and commits if errors found or ways for making the processing
more symplistic.
