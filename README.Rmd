# Repository ``r repo_name``

This GitHub repository is made for storing the code and associated documents for processing the National Institute of Health proposals that are submitted at Duke University on a quarterly basis (e.g., Jan - Mar, Apr - Jun, Jul - Sep, Oct - Dec). This code is made specifically for processing the raw .csv files from the various internal websites at Duke (e..g,  SPS, RCR Tracker, LDap, etc.) and preparing the an import file for the REDCap _Proposal Award Tracker_.

For those not affiliated with Duke University, this repository as a whole will not be useful. However, the code may be helpful, and we welcome and commits if errors found or ways for making the processing more symplistic.

|                 when necessary)
|
|--- R            (R functions created for this project live here)
|
|--- renv         (System library necesssary for `renv` to work. DON'T TOUCH)
